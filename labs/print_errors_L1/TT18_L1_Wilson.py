# Name: Chandler Wilson
# COSC1336, Lab 1, Fix print syntax errors
#
# An easy first program prints out a few words, like: Hello, world!
# But when learning a brand new language, even something
# "easy" can be difficult. Find and fix any errors below.
#
# There should be a space between words in your output.
# Each statement displays some text.
# Repair each output instruction so it outputs correctly.
# If it is NOT broken, don't fix it.
# These can be repaired with the proper use of the print function
# and the proper use of string __deliminators__ << typo?.

# On that last sentance I believe you mean delimiters.

does this work?
working or not
how about this?
is this right?
Can you see me now?

try it this way!!
Who cares where the verb goes?
Start End
give me a shout when it works

If this were easy, anyone could do it!
Quote the raven: 'Nevermore'
She said: 'Where's my cell phone? I've got to find it!'
Here are four quote marks: ''''
How could something so easy be so difficult?

That is about enough of this.
